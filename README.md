# Revenue Analysis Dashboard New MRR Total Revenue and Cohort Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the creation of a comprehensive Revenue Analysis Dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard includes three key analytical views: New Monthly Recurring Revenue (New MRR), Total Revenue with Month-over-Month Change, and a Cohort Analysis of Revenue. These views provide valuable insights into the revenue generated by new users, overall revenue trends, and the performance of different user cohorts over time.
